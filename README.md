## 1.3 Project Description.

3-way login system, where the user can either be a subscriber, chef, or delivery driver.

Customer: Browse different restaurants and see their menus and place orders. Enter location using either GPS/Manual entry. Updates throughout order to check the process. Recieve an order number to show to the designated delivery driver. Maybe a review system as well. Temporary private message with driver. Potential refund system in case something is missing (verified by photos taken by driver and restaurant) - refund time limit ? Recommended suggestions based of order history - (if we have time). Filters for dining references e.g. (Allergies, Vegan, Halal - these are specified on the order). An order history so they can order again.

Chef: Be able to post a menu onto the website, update the menu's current availability with a stock system. Be able to give a rough time estimate to the driver; receive order with order number to give the delivery driver, this order would recieve information about allerigies or dining preferences for the customer.

Delivery driver: Receive an order when they have no current orders they're currently working on. Ideally closest driver to pick-up point would be selected for the delivery. They would recieve a pick-up number to show the chef and a drop-off number to show the customer. They may also need a temporary direct message system to the customer and the chef.
