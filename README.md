## 1.2 Project Description
Our delivery app aims to create a seamless experience for customers, chefs, and delivery drivers alike. 

Customers can browse through an array of restaurants, view menus, and place orders effortlessly. They can input their location via GPS or manual entry and receive real-time updates to monitor their order progress. Each customer is provided with a unique order number to present to their designated driver. The app also features optional functionalities like a review system, temporary private messaging with the driver, and even a potential refund mechanism backed by photo verification. If time permits, the app will offer personalized food recommendations based on previous order history. Customers can also set filters to match their specific dining needs such as allergies, vegan options, or Halal food.

For chefs, the platform offers the ability to upload and manage menus, update food item availability via a stock management system, and communicate estimated preparation times to drivers. Chefs also receive orders complete with customer preferences and dietary needs.

Delivery drivers are assigned orders based on their proximity to the pick-up location, ensuring efficiency. They receive unique pick-up and drop-off numbers for verification purposes and can use a temporary messaging system for coordinating with chefs and customers. This holistic approach aims to streamline the food ordering and delivery process for all parties involved.

## 1.3 User Stories

As a **customer**, I seek a way to browse available options for meals which can be delivered to me in subsequent days; the food delivery will be cooked ready for reheating, and will arrive in a reuseable container which I can then return to a driver at a later time.

As a **chef**, I wish to receive orders promptly after they are processed, so that I can quickly prepare food for delivery within the following days.

As a **delivery driver**, I would like to receive a daily quota of deliveries to be made, complete with a pick-up and drop-off location so that I can deliver food quickly and efficiently. Ideally my drop-off locations would be as close to each other as possible.

## 1.4 Stake Holders

- **Chefs/restaurants** have the option to sign up to the service so that they can sell and distribute their meals to customers in reusable containers which will be returned to them. 
- **Customers** can place orders for meals to be delivered to them on following days in reusable containers; at a later time or during their next order the container can be collected by a driver to be returned to the chef/restaurant.
- **Delivery Drivers** will sign up to the service and receive notifications of nearby orders to pick up/customers to deliver to/containers to collect. They are able to verify deliveries by a customer's username and unique order code. They should have some way of storing the reusable containers during journeys, and ideally would be either travelling either by bicycle or electric vehicle.
- **The client** will have created a sustainable, eco-friendly delivery service in which food containers are reused and orders are delivered by green vehicles.
