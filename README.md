## 1.2 Goals
Our delivery app aims to create a seamless experience for customers, chefs, and delivery drivers alike. 

Customers can browse through an array of restaurants, view menus, and place orders effortlessly. They can input their location via GPS or manual entry and receive real-time updates to monitor their order progress. Each customer is provided with a unique order number to present to their designated driver. The app also features optional functionalities like a review system, temporary private messaging with the driver, and even a potential refund mechanism backed by photo verification. If time permits, the app will offer personalized food recommendations based on previous order history. Customers can also set filters to match their specific dining needs such as allergies, vegan options, or Halal food.

For chefs, the platform offers the ability to upload and manage menus, update food item availability via a stock management system, and communicate estimated preparation times to drivers. Chefs also receive orders complete with customer preferences and dietary needs.

Delivery drivers are assigned orders based on their proximity to the pick-up location, ensuring efficiency. They receive unique pick-up and drop-off numbers for verification purposes and can use a temporary messaging system for coordinating with chefs and customers. This holistic approach aims to streamline the food ordering and delivery process for all parties involved.
